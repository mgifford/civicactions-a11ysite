<p>When we talk about testing websites for accessibility, one of the most
frequently cited statistics is that automated testing discovers
<a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/blog/automated-accessibility-testing-tools-how-much-do-scans-catch/">30%</a> to 60% of the errors we need to address. (Aside:
that discrepancy seems to be due to how you define the number of errors, <a href="https://www.deque.com/automated-accessibility-testing-coverage/">by
type or frequency</a>.) No matter which number is cited, this means a significant number
of accessibility violations, around 40–70%, still require an actual human user
to verify.</p>
<p>This past year, from November 2022 to now, the accessibility practice for the
Web Experience and Content Management Services (WECMS) team, which supports
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), has increased our manual testing
efforts. With all of this in mind, I thought it would be interesting to
quantify how much effort we spent verifying accessibility issues via automated
testing, manual testing, or a combination of both — especially as this relates
to concerns raised in the recently published <a href="https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/">Government-wide Section 508 Assessment</a>. A
few of the
<a href="https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/criteria-01/">criteria</a>
directly address manual testing efforts:</p>
<p>13/ If your agency uses a manual and/or hybrid ICT accessibility test
methodology for web content, which manual test methodology or methodologies
does your agency use?</p>
<p>47/ Indicate how often your agency conducts comprehensive manual conformance
validation testing for web content (internet and intranet) prior to deployment
to address all applicable Section 508 standards.</p>
<p>68/ How many public internet web pages were evaluated by a combination of both
automated and manual testing in the reporting period?</p>
<h3>Assessment methods</h3>
<p>We can determine which form of testing — automated, manual, or both — was
required for our project's tickets by looking at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) success
criteria</a> that apply to each issue/ticket. A
very small number of WCAG criteria can be verified by automated testing alone;
the vast majority require some degree of manual review. For example, an ARIA
label that satisfies <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and
Relationships</a> can be
detected by an automated test, but the value must be reviewed manually by a
person to confirm that it makes sense.</p>
<p>First, I added labels to all accessibility issues in Jira resolved between
November 2022 and 2023 that reference the relevant WCAG criteria (i.e.,
&quot;WCAG-2.5.3&quot;). While this exercise was somewhat time-consuming —we logged
around 300 accessibility issues total across 7 websites — it was well worth
the time as it will greatly simplify updates to our upcoming annual reporting
process. So, win-win.</p>
<p>Then I mapped the testing method to each criterion in this matrix (see
Appendix A: Required testing methods by WCAG criteria), based on a <a href="https://blog.usablenet.com/automated-wcag-testing-is-not-enough-for-web-accessibility-ada-compliance">similar
matrix published by Usablenet</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/rule-descriptions.md">axe-core
rule definitions</a>. Each axe-core rule is assigned an Issue Type, which notes
whether a rule can result in failure (a clear accessibility violation), or if
it needs review, which <a href="https://docs.deque.com/devtools-html/4.0.0/en/needs-review-incomplete">Deque defines as</a>, &quot;there may or not be an accessibility
issue and more investigation is required.&quot; If an axe-core rule's issue type
includes &quot;needs review,&quot; that rule, and by extension the WCAG criteria tested,
may require manual testing.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>We logged around 300 accessibility issues total, however only <strong>230 tickets</strong>
represented WCAG violations (the rest related to best practices or discovery).
Of those:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>146</strong> required both automated and manual testing</li>
<li><strong>72</strong> could be verified with manual tests only</li>
<li><strong>12</strong> could be verified with automated tests only</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UbQcDJBrMWtb4wgBqxv2gA.jpeg" alt="Pie chart with accessibility issues by testing method, Manual tests
31.3%, Automated tests 5.2% and manual + automated tests
63.5%"></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The WECMS team made great strides with manual testing in 2023, and testing in
general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the WCAG violations we fixed were verified by a person using a keyboard or screen reader, and/or by considering context, meaning, purpose, logical placement, and allowed exceptions.</li>
<li>Code written by our engineers consistently has few objective errors that can be discovered with automated testing. I can vouch for our design and development teams using semantic markup, including text labels, checking color values, and overall creating templates and experiences that will pass automated checks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise showed that manual testing is not only necessary, it accounts
for most of the time we spend verifying accessibility conformance for the
WECMS websites. We can now use these results to inform how much effort we put
toward, for example, team training on screen reader use, and it can fine-tune
how we prioritize time and resources for remediating issues.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that while we're growing more proficient with
manual testing tools and methods, usability testing with disabled people — the
true experts when it comes to assessing a website's accessibility — should
continue to be a top goal for our accessibility practice.</p>
