<p><em>GCN</em> (Now called Route-Fifty) published a guest editorial we wrote that was inspired by a conversation we had on a recent CivicActions Accessibility practice area call.</p>
<p>From the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baking VPAT into the code-as-compliance process isn't a panacea. But it is a humble beginning to prioritizing accessibility and making a cumbersome process less so. By shifting the mindset and approach to one of open principles, machine-readable accessibility can become equally important to security in the compliance process.</p>
