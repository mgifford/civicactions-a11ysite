<p>To help government agencies holistically address digital accessibility, we've developed a phased organizational framework we call <a href="/heart">HEART</a>.</p>
<p>Holistic Enterprise Accessibility Review Technique is a proactive, interactive process to ensure government digital services are accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>HEART provides guidance for all stakeholders and aims to address every aspect of organizational operations, including policy, procurement, technical, resourcing and culture.</p>
