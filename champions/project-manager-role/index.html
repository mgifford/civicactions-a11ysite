<hr>
<p>Project managers keep teams aligned and delivery predictable. Embedding accessibility into schedules, risks, and communications keeps it from slipping.</p>
<h2>Project manager actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add accessibility tasks to sprint plans and milestones; avoid “phase later” deferrals.</li>
<li>Track risks for accessibility regressions and surface them in status reports.</li>
<li>Ensure time is allocated for manual checks (keyboard, screen reader smoke tests, zoom/contrast) before release.</li>
<li>Coordinate user testing that includes people with disabilities and assistive tech.</li>
</ul>
