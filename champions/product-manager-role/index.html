<hr>
<p>Product managers turn accessibility into roadmap reality. They balance user needs, scope, and delivery so accessible experiences ship and stay maintained.</p>
<h2>Product manager actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define accessibility as a core acceptance criterion for every epic and user story.</li>
<li>Prioritize fixes based on user impact and risk, not just compliance severity.</li>
<li>Schedule recurring audits (automated and manual) and track debt in the backlog.</li>
<li>Coordinate with design, engineering, QA, and content so accessibility stays aligned across releases.</li>
</ul>
