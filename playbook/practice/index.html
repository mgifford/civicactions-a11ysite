        <p>Within and across government departments, people with related knowledge and responsibilities are often scattered. Without a deliberate effort to build a shared understanding and define how digital accessibility is done, the approach and expertise can vary widely. Establishing a community of practice can make it easier to share knowledge and best practices, and help your organization align behind common goals for digital accessibility.</p>
<p>Digital accessibility requires technical knowledge, but also personal empathy. Understanding how others experience the digital world is critical for addressing their needs. Therefore, it's crucial that a community of practice on accessibility involves people with disabilities.</p>
<p>As a whole, government bodies need to get better at identifying accessibility barriers, removing them from their systems, and preventing new ones from occurring. This will take a real community effort, and current approaches have not been up to the task. Building a community of people who are working together to identify, resolve and prevent errors will make your organization's accessibility goals more achievable and sustainable.</p>
<p>The BBC is a real leader in this space, building out a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/champions/">Champions Network</a>. Not everyone can be an accessibility expert, but we can have more people who care enough about it to become champions. Ability net has a great resource on <a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/news-blogs/how-build-and-grow-your-accessibility-champions-network">how to build and grow your accessibility champions network</a>.</p>
