        <p>Digital accessibility tools can help ensure that the content you create is meeting accessibility guidelines. This page lists a variety of tools that designers, developers, and others can use to make web content more accessible. We have focused on open source tools, as they are the easiest to adopt and scale for most organizations.</p>
<h2>Authoring</h2>
<p>An authoring tool is software that can be used to create or modify content for use by others. These tools should allow authors to create accessible content from the beginning, without having to come up with a workaround. Output should conform to WCAG Level A and Level AA Success Criteria and Conformance Requirements. These are some authoring tools we recommend.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sa11y.netlify.app/">Sa11y</a>: This is an accessibility quality assurance assistant that visually highlights common accessibility and usability issues on a web page.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/itmaybejj/editoria11y">Editoria11y</a>: This highlights common issues inline within the content editor.</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>: This is a content management system and has modules that can enhance its accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Automated testing</h2>
<p>Automated accessibility testing should occur at different stages when creating digital content, from design to development. We recommend getting started with these tools and learning more about how to <a href="https://accessibility.civicactions.com/playbook/automated-testing">implement automated testing</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/component-driven/cypress-axe">Cypress with axe core</a>: This combines the JavaScript testing framework of Cypress with the popular accessibility testing engine, axe core.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci">Pa11y CI</a>: This is a continuous integration (CI) runner that can test a few pages or an entire site for accessibility issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bookmarklets</h2>
<p>Bookmarklets provide quick, automated checks for accessibility issues. They can test for a wide variety of issues, such as testing interactive elements, focus, touch events, and reading order. These are some of the bookmarklets that we recommend, but there are many more out there!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ada.is/blog/2016/02/12/contrast-bookmarklet/">Accessibility and Contrast Bookmarklet</a>: Analyze the contrast of the text on a page and highlight elements which may have readability issues.</li>

It also gives realistic recommendations to improve accessibility.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Color contrast checker</h2>
<p>Color contrast is an important part of accessibility. Text and background colors must have enough contrast so that the content on the page can be easily seen. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 suggest a minimum contrast of 4:5:1. W3C has an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html">Understanding SC 1.4.3 page</a> that explains this in greater detail, if you are new to accessibility <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/">WebAim has great resources</a>. These tools can help quickly check if the colors on a page meet these guidelines.</p>
